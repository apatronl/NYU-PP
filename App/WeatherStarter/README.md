# Getting Started

We are going to be building a simple app that displays the current and daily weather for New York City. When we're done, this is what your app will look like:



## Pre-requisites
- Have an Apple computer (or Virtual Machine)
- Have Xcode installed

## Set-up

### 1. Download Xcode

First things first, make sure to download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). This is the integrated development environment (IDE) that we will use to build our app.

### 2. Get your API key

We will be using the[ Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to get forecast data. Make sure to create a free account and get your API key.

</p>

### 3. Download starter code

Download this Github repository to your computer and open the **starter** Xcode project (`WeatherStarter.xcodeproj`).

### 4. Run the app

Once the project is open, we're going to run the app in a simulator. To select a simulator device, press the device selector at the center top. For example, I have selected the iPhone 16 Pro simulator.

<img src="img/simulator.png" alt="drawing" style="width:200px;"/>
</p>

Next, we can press the play icon, on the top left, to run our starter app. Once the simulator is open you should see something like this:

<img src="img/starter_app.png" alt="drawing" style="width:200px;"/>
</p>

Don't worry, during the lunch n' learn session we'll fix any UI that looks weird right now, and we'll be showing real live weather data for New York City.

### 5. [Optional] But very useful

Watch Apple's [SwiftUI Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10150/) video.
