# About the app

This project is a simple app that displays New York City's weather. It was created by [Alejandrina Patr√≥n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandrinapatron/) and [Julian Ozen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianozen/) to teach the basics of iOS app development to fellow Tech MBA students at NYU.
